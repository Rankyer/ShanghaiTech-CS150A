			            \item Each player can have at most one contract.
			            \item A team has at least one contract.
			            \item Relation \textbf{Represents} involves entities \textbf{Player} and \textbf{Agent}; relation \textbf{Contracts} involves

		            \end{itemize}
		            (Hint: you should add 6 edges in total.) \\

		      \item \textbf{[1 point]} As \textbf{Supporter} is a weak entity that must have unique and total participation in the \textbf{Supports} relation,
		            its primary key is determined by which attribute(s) in the ER-diagram? \\

	      \end{itemize}


	\item \textbf{[3 points]} \textbf{Normalization and Decomposition} \\
	      Decompose ABCDEFGH into Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) in the order of the following FDs:

	      \end{itemize}


	\item \textbf{[6 points]} \textbf{Parallel Algorithm} \\
	      Assume that we have a 100 page table R that we will join with a 400 page table S.
	      All the pages start on machine 1, and there are 4 machines in total with 30 buffer pages each.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item[(a)] \textbf{[2 points]} How many passes are needed to do a parallel unoptimized Sort-Merge Join (SMJ) on the data? For
		            this question a pass is defined as a full pass over either table (so if we have to do 1 pass over R and 1 pass
		            over S it is 2 total passes). \\
		      \item[(b)] \textbf{[2 points]} How many passes are needed to a parallel Grace Hash Join on the data? \\
		      \item[(c)] \textbf{[2 points]} We want to calculate the max in parallel using hierarchical aggregation. What value should
		            each machine calculate and what should the coordinator do with those values? \\

\section{MapReduce and Spark \textbf{[10 points]}}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{[3 points]} \textbf{Basics} \\
	      Select all the true statement(s): \\
	      A. In MapReduce, the Map phase applies a function in parallel to every element of a set of data, and the Reduce phase combines the
	      results of the Map phase into the desired data output. \\
	      B. In Distributed File System (DFS), a file system in which large files are partitioned into smaller files,
	      and then distributed and replicated several times on different nodes for fault tolerance. \\
	      C. Both the Map and Reduce phases can be split among different
	      workers on different machines, with workers performing independent tasks in parallel. \\
	      D. Since the Reduce phase must wait until the entire Map phase completes, we must restart the entire Map phase if one map task
	      fails. \\
	      E. Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) are not written to disk in intermediate steps but are rather stored in main memory. \\
	      F. Similar with MapReduce, Spark needs to write intermediate results to disk. \\

\section{Data Mining and Machine Learning \textbf{[10 points]}}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{[2 points]} \textbf{Basics} \\
	      Select all the true statement(s): \\
	      A. The order of the basic KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Database) process is Data Selection, Data Cleaning, Data Mining \& ML, Evaluation. \\
	      B. The ultimate goal in machine learning is to find a model that best fits the training data. \\
	      C. The $k$-means algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. \\
	      D. A common form of feature engineering on continuous data is one-hot-encoding. \\

	\item \textbf{[4 points]} \textbf{K-Means}
	      \begin{itemize}

		      \item[(a)] \textbf{[2 points]}
		            Which of the following can act as possible termination conditions in $k$-means?
		            (you may select one or more than one of the choices.)\\
		            A. For a fixed number of iterations.\\
		            B. Assignment of observations to clusters does not change between iterations. Except for cases with a bad local minimum.\\
		            C. Centroids do not change between successive iterations.\\
		            D. Terminate when the objective value falls below a threshold. \\


		      \item[(b)] \textbf{[2 points]}
		            In which of the following cases will $k$-means clustering fail to give good results?
		            (you may mark zero ($\phi$), one or more than one of the choices.)\\
		            A. Data points with outliers.\\
		            B. Data points with different densities.\\
		            C. Data points with round shapes.\\
		            D. Data points with non-convex shapes. \\

	      \end{itemize}



	\item \textbf{[4 points]} \textbf{Linear Regression} \\
	      Given $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training samples
	      $\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ... , (x_n, y_n)\}$, with the $i$-th sample $x_i, y_i \in \mathbb{R}$, $i=1,2,...,n$.
	      Consider the linear model:
	      \begin{equation}
		      y = x\theta + \epsilon \quad \epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma^{2}),
	      \end{equation}
	      where $\mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma^{2})$ denotes the Guassian distribution with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$.
	      Assume that the training data has been centralized, such that the intercept can be ignored in the above linear model.
	      Obviously, the probability density function of $y$ conditioned on $x$ and $\theta$ follows the Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(x\theta,\sigma)$,
	      which is defined by
	      \begin{equation}
		      p(y|x,\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-x\theta)^2).
	      \end{equation}
	      The model parameter $\theta$ can be estimated based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which aims to maximize the likelihood function:
	      \begin{align}
		      L(\theta) & = \prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i,y_i|\theta) \nonumber                                                    \\
		                & = \prod_{i=1}^n P(y_i|x_i,\theta)P(x_i) \nonumber                                              \\
		                & = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp(-\frac{(y_i - x_i\theta)^2}{2\sigma^2})P(x_i).
	      \end{align}
	      (Hint: $P(x_i)$ ($i=1,2,...,n$) can be treated as a constant in the above formulation.)
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item[(a)] \textbf{[2 points]} Show the log-likelihood function $\log L(\theta)$. (The base of the log function is $e$.) \\
		      \item[(b)] \textbf{[2 points]} Apply MLE to calculate the closed-form solution of $\theta$. \\
	      \end{itemize}
