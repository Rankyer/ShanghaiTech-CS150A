## Notes:
+ There is no quiz part in 2024 Spring, the quiz I uploaded is from the previous terms and ***there are some mistakes!!!***, so it's suggested that you attend the lecture and Find out what's wrong. 🙂
+ The grade compositionin 2024 Spring includes 30% HW (10% for each HW), 30% Midterm, 40% Final.
+ The standard HW solution I uploaded may not be complete and some parts will be missing (since the TA team didn't release all HW solution)，and I have uploaded what the TA team provided.
